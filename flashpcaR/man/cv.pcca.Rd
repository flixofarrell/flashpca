\arguments{
\item{X}{An n by p numeric matrix. Note: PLINK data is currently not supported.}

\item{Y}{An n by k numeric matrix.}

\item{ndim}{Integer. Positive number of canonical vectors to compute.}

\item{kx}{Numeric. Number of principal components to compute for X.}

\item{ky}{Numeric. Number of principal components to compute for Y.}

\item{nfolds}{Integer. Number of cross-validation folds.}

\item{folds}{Integer. The fold identifiers. Overrides the `nfolds'
parameter.}

\item{standx}{Character. One of "sd" (empricial standard deviation) or "none".}

\item{standy}{Character. One of "sd" (empricial standard deviation) or "none".}

\item{check_sign}{Logical. Whether to check and correct possible sign flips 
of the singular vectors within the cross-validation.}

\item{final_model}{Logical. Whether to return a \code{pcca} model trained
on all the data.}

\item{svd_tol}{Numeric. Tolerance under which to truncate singular values of X and Y.}
